    <h1>Demonstrating the box model</h1>
    <p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.</p>
    <div class="box">
        <p>This text is the context of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 15px green border. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting.</p>
